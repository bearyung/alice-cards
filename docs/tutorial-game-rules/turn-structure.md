# Turn Structure

Each player's turn in 'Alice: Cards of Wonder' consists of the following steps:

## Step 1: Refine the Gem

If you possess the required elements for one of the gems (Red, Green, or Purple), you must refine it at the start of your turn. Only one gem can be refined during this step.

## Step 2: Reap and Heal

### Reap
- If your Creature Cards in play with element matches the element on the Environment card, place a “Reap” token on the Creature card and turn it 90 degrees to show it is “exhausted.” During the Collect Elements step, you gain the corresponding element.

    :::warning Attentions
    Only undamaged creatures can Reap.
    :::

### Heal
- Reduce any damage on your creatures by 1.

:::info Order of Actions
The actions in this step must be performed in order (Reap, then Heal). You may choose to skip either the Reap, the Heal, or even the entire step, but you cannot perform Heal before Reap.
:::

## Step 3: Maintain or Change Environment

### Story Mode
- If there was a fight in the last round, the current environment is **collapsed** regardless of which player initiated the fight. The collapsed environment must be changed. Move the current environment card to the bottom of the environment card deck, face down, and enter the next environment.

### Free Mode
- You may choose to change the Environment card in play by drawing the first card from the shuffled environment card deck. If you choose to change the environment, the remaining steps will be passed, and play will be passed to the next player.

    :::warning Attentions
    In Free Mode, the environment **will not be collapsed** even if there was a fight in the last round.
    :::

:::info Effects of Changing Environment
If the environment has changed to a new one, the reaping characters will lose their reap state. The elements gained from the reap should be put back into the pool, and the reaping characters should be turned back from the exhausted position to the ready position.
:::

## Step 4: Declare the Creature

Declare which Creature you will use for this turn by flipping the corresponding Identity Card face up. 

## Step 5: Play, Discard, Recycle or Use Cards

You can perform these actions (Play, Discard, Recycle, Use a Creature) in any order and repeat them any number of times within your turn.

### Play a Card
- Play Creature, Artifact, and Action cards. Players can have a **maximum of 6 characters** in play.

    :::info Maximum Characters in Play
    If you already have 6 characters in play, you can either declare a fight with an opponent (and potentially lose a character) or recycle attached artifacts and then discard the character. 
    :::
    
    :::warning Attention
    Remember, recycling can only occur if the character has no damage.
    :::

### Discard
- Discard any number of cards from your hand or in play that belong to the declared Creature.

    :::warning Discarding Restrictions
    Only creatures or artifacts without any damage can be discarded.
    :::

### Recycle
- You may choose to discard Artifact cards attached to your declared creature. Doing so allows you to collect elements represented by the Artifact Cards by moving the discarded Artifact cards to the discard pile and the gained elements to the Creature card.

    :::warning Attention
    Only creatures without any damage can recycle their attached Artifact(s). If the creature is defeated in this turn, the elements will be awarded to your opponent.
    :::

### Use a Creature
- Initiate a fight by turning your Creature card 90 degrees to an **exhausted** position. Choose an opponent’s creature to fight. Creatures deal damage simultaneously. The winner can collect elements from the opponent’s creature if it has Artifacts (items) attached.

    :::info Exhausted Creatures
    An "exhausted" character cannot be used again in this turn.
    :::


## Step 6: Ready Cards and Collect Elements

Turn all **exhausted** cards back to a ready position. Collect any elements gained during your turn.

:::info Notes
There is a maximum capacity for each element type, based on the available space on your Gem Tokens. If you cannot place a gained element due to lack of capacity, you must discard that element.
:::

## Step 7: Draw Cards

Draw cards until you have six in your hand. If you already have six or more cards, discard down to six.

## Step 8: End Turn and Pass to Opponent

Once you have completed all previous steps, your turn comes to an end. Indicate the end of your turn to your opponent. Play then passes to them, and they begin their turn starting from **Step 1**.

## Game Flow

The game continues in this turn-based manner, with each player following the steps from 1 to 8 during their turn. This loop continues until the winning conditions are met.
