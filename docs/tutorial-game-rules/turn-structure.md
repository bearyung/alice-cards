# Turn Structure

Each player's turn in 'Alice: Cards of Wonder' consists of the following steps:

## Step 1: Refine the Gem

If you possess the required elements for one of the gems (Red, Green, or Purple), you must refine it at the start of your turn. Only one gem can be refined during this step.

## Step 2: Declare the Creature

Declare which Creature you will use for this turn by flipping the corresponding Creature Token face up. The opposing player (passive player) does not take any actions during this step.

## Step 3: Maintain or Change Environment

You may choose to change the Environment card in play or even discard the current Environment card. The game round can continue without an Environment card. Without an Environment card, you may still collect elements by winning battles.

## Step 4: Reap and Heal

### Reap
- If your Creature Card’s element matches the element on the Environment card, place a “Reap” token on the Creature card and turn it 90 degrees to show it is “exhausted.” During the Collect Elements step, you gain the corresponding element.

    :::info Notes
    Only undamaged creatures can Reap.
    :::

### Heal
- Reduce any damage on your creatures by 1.

## Step 5: Play, Discard, Recycle or Use Cards

You can perform these actions (Play, Discard, Use a Creature) in any order and repeat them any number of times within your turn.

### Play a Card
- Play Creature, Artifact, and Action cards. Environments can affect the Creature, altering abilities, attack/defense levels, and Artifact capacity.

### Discard
- Discard any number of cards from your hand or in play that belong to the declared Creature. Environment cards can be discarded freely as they are not specific to any Creature.

### Recycle
- You may choose to discard Artifact cards attached to your declared creature. Doing so allows you to collect elements represented by the Artifact Cards by moving the discarded Artifact cards to the discard pile and the gained elements to the Creature card.

    :::info Notes
    Only creatures without any damage can recycle Artifact cards. If the creature is defeated in this turn, the elements will be awarded to your opponent.
    :::

### Use a Creature
- Initiate a fight by turning your Creature card 90 degrees to an “exhausted” position. Choose an opponent’s creature to battle. Creatures deal damage simultaneously. The winner can collect elements from the opponent’s creature if it has Artifacts attached.

## Step 6: Ready Cards and Collect Elements

Turn all “exhausted” cards back to a ready position. Collect any elements gained during your turn.

:::info Notes
There is a maximum capacity for each element type, based on the available space on your Gem Tokens. If you cannot place a gained element due to lack of capacity, you must discard that element.
:::

## Step 7: Draw Cards

Draw cards until you have six in your hand. If you already have six or more cards, discard down to six.

## Step 8: End Turn and Pass to Opponent

Once you have completed all previous steps, your turn comes to an end. Indicate the end of your turn to your opponent. Play then passes to them, and they begin their turn starting from **Step 1**.

## Game Flow

The game continues in this turn-based manner, with each player following the steps from 1 to 8 during their turn. This loop continues until the winning conditions are met.
