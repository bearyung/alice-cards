# Interactions and Combos

"Alice: Cards of Wonder" is a game rich in strategic depth, largely due to the dynamic interactions and combinations possible between different card types. Understanding these interactions can unlock powerful combos and strategies, providing players with a competitive edge.

## Synergy Between Card Types:

### Creature and Artifact Synergy

Creatures can be equipped with Artifacts to enhance their abilities, attack, and defense stats. Defensive Artifacts create formidable defenses when paired with high-health characters, while offensive Artifacts amplify attack capabilities. Some Artifacts activate additional abilities or effects when paired with specific creatures, aligning with the creature's theme or element.

### Action Cards and Strategic Timing

Action cards, being single-use, can have game-changing effects. Timing their use to complement your active creature's abilities or counter an opponent's move can swing the momentum in your favor. For example, using an Action card that allows for an additional attack can be devastating when combined with a Creature card already enhanced with offensive Artifacts.

### Environment Cards as Game Changers

Environment cards can dramatically alter the game state by enhancing certain creatures or artifacts, or providing favorable conditions for certain strategies. A well-timed Environment card can bolster your creatures' abilities, hinder your opponents, or change the way elements are collected for a turn.

## Potential Combos and Strategies

### Element Collection and Gem Refinement

Combining Creature abilities that allow for efficient element collection with strategic use of environments and artifacts can expedite gem refinement. 

For example, a Creature can reap Water elements in a Water environment or collect Water-related artifacts by winning battles against opponents. Preventing opponents from reaping elements by attacking and damaging their creatures is also a strategic move.

### Defensive and Offensive Balances

Balancing defensive and offensive strategies is key. A Creature with high defense can be paired with Artifacts and Action cards that provide offensive boosts, creating a balanced approach to both protecting your elements and attacking your opponent.

### Disrupting Opponent’s Strategy

Use Lock Tokens to indicate that a creature or artifact is temporarily disabled. Locking down an opponent's powerful Creature or Artifact at a crucial moment can provide a significant advantage, as it prevents them from using that card's abilities or effects until the Lock Token is removed.

### Environment and Creature Alignment

Aligning Environment cards with your active Creature’s element can maximize your turn's effectiveness. For example, playing an Environment card that benefits Earth elements when your active Creature is Earth-aligned can provide a tactical advantage.
