# Handling of Cards

Proper handling of cards in "Alice: Cards of Wonder" is essential for fair and smooth gameplay. This section outlines the rules for drawing, shuffling, discarding, and managing your hand and deck.

## Drawing Cards

**Beginning of the Game:** Each player starts the game by drawing six cards from the deck.

**During the Game:** At the beginning of your turn, unless specified otherwise by game rules or card abilities, you maintain a hand of six cards. Draw cards at the end of your turn to reach this number.

**Deck Depletion:** If your deck runs out of cards, shuffle your discard pile to create a new draw deck. Continue drawing as required.

## Shuffling Cards

**Game Start:** Thoroughly shuffle your deck before starting the game.

**During Play:** Certain card abilities or game rules may require you to shuffle your deck or hand during the game. Follow the card instructions for when and how to shuffle.

**Fair Play:** Ensure shuffling is done fairly and thoroughly to maintain the randomness of card distribution.

## Discarding Cards

**Discard Actions:** During your turn, you may be required to discard cards from your hand or in play. This can be due to playing Action cards, using abilities, or as a result of an opponent's actions.

**Discard Pile:** All discarded cards should be placed in your discard pile, face up. Keep your discard pile separate from your draw deck and other game components.

**Card Retrieval:** Unless retrieved through specific card abilities, discarded cards remain in the discard pile until the draw deck needs to be reshuffled.

## Managing Your Hand and Deck

**Hand Limit:** The standard hand limit is six cards. If you ever have more than six cards in your hand at the end of your turn, you must discard down to six.

**Hand Visibility:** Keep your hand hidden from other players, unless a card ability states otherwise.

**Deck and Discard Pile:** Maintain clear separation between your deck, your hand, and your discard pile to avoid confusion.
