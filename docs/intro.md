# Introduction

Let's rediscover the **Wonderland**.

## The Return to Wonderland: A New Chapter Begins

Years have passed since Alice first tumbled down the rabbit hole into the enchanting realm of Wonderland. Now a young girl, she carries the memories of that fantastical world as distant, dream-like whispers. Life in the ordinary world continued, but part of her always yearned for the magic and mystery of the lands she once explored.

Then, on an ordinary day cloaked in the mundane, the extraordinary happened: the White Rabbit, with his waistcoat and pocket watch, darted past her once more. Her heart raced with recognition and excitement. The scene, so vivid and surreal, mirrored that fateful day from her childhood. With wide eyes and a hopeful heart, Alice followed, knowing deep within that the rabbit hole – the gateway to Wonderland – **had reopened**.

Stepping into the rabbit hole this time, Alice finds Wonderland both familiar and transformed. Characters she once knew have evolved, and new faces have emerged. The lands are more whimsical, more challenging, more mysterious. It’s a Wonderland reborn, teeming with puzzles to solve, battles to be won, and secrets to uncover. Among these faces, the formidable Queen of Hearts casts a long shadow, her presence as enigmatic and commanding as ever.
