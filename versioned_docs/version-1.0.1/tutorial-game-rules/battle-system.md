# Battle System

Understanding the battle system in **Alice: Cards of Wonder** is crucial for effective gameplay. This guide covers all aspects of engaging in fights, managing creatures, and utilizing cards to gain an advantage.

## 1. Creature's Health Points (HP)

- **Definition**: Each Creature's Health Points (HP) represent its vitality and ability to withstand damage.
- **Calculation**: The total HP of a creature is calculated by summing its total Attack Power and Defense Power. For example, if a creature has an Artifact card with Attack 3 and Defense 2, the creature’s HP is 5. All Artifact cards are designed with a total of 5 points for easy calculation (e.g., an Artifact with Attack 5 has Defense 0, and an Artifact with Attack 1 has Defense 4).
- **Tracking**: HP is tracked using Health Point (HP) Tokens placed on the Creature card.
- **Impact**: When a Creature takes damage, its HP decreases. If a Creature's HP drops to zero, it is defeated and moved to the discard pile.

## 2. Creature's Artifact Capacity

- **Definition**: Artifact capacity refers to the number of Artifact cards that a Creature can hold and use simultaneously.
- **Limitations**: Each Creature has a specific Artifact capacity based on its attributes.
- **Strategy**: Balancing the type and number of Artifacts attached to a Creature can enhance its abilities and improve its performance in battles.

## 3. The Attack Power

- **Definition**: Attack Power determines the amount of damage a Creature can inflict during a fight.
- **Calculation**: Attack Power is the sum of the values provided by attached Artifacts and bonuses from Action cards.
- **Usage**: During a fight, a Creature's Attack Power directly determines the damage dealt to the opponent's creature. Even if the attacking creature has only 1 HP left, it can still inflict damage based on its full Attack Power.

## 4. The Defense Power

- **Definition**: Defense Power represents the damage a Creature inflicts back on the attacker during a fight.
- **Calculation**: Defense Power is the sum of the defense values provided by attached Artifacts and bonuses from Action cards.
- **Usage**: During a fight, a Creature's Defense Power is applied as damage to the attacking creature. It does not reduce the incoming damage but instead retaliates, causing damage to the attacker based on the Creature’s Defense Power.

## 5. Creatures Without Artifacts

- **Definition**: A Creature without any Artifacts attached is considered to be in its base state.
- **Attack Power**: Without any Artifacts, a Creature's Attack Power is 1.
- **Defense Power**: Without any Artifacts, a Creature's Defense Power is 1.
- **HP**: Without any Artifacts, a Creature's HP is 1.
- **Implication**: Despite their vulnerability, such Creatures still play an important role in battles. Even with minimal power, they can be crucial, especially when the opponent only has 1 HP left. Therefore, it's not always about the strength, but strategic use of these Creatures can turn the tide of the battle.

## 6. Engaging in Fight

- **Initiating a Fight**: Declare a fight by turning your active Creature card 90 degrees to an "exhausted" position.
- **Battle Steps**:
  - The attacking Creature’s Attack Power is applied directly as damage to the opponent’s creature.
  - Simultaneously, the defending Creature’s Defense Power is applied as damage to the attacking Creature.
  - Both creatures deal damage to each other based on their respective Attack and Defense Powers.
- **Outcome**:
  - Apply the damage calculated from Attack and Defense Powers to each Creature’s HP.
  - If a Creature’s HP reaches zero, it is defeated and moved to the discard pile.
  - The attacking Creature can collect elements from the opponent's defeated Creature if it has attached Artifacts.
  

  :::warning Attentions
  Only attacking Creatures can collect elements. Defending Creatures cannot collect elements from attacking Creatures, even if the attacking Creature is defeated.
  :::
  
- **Simultaneous Defeat**:
  - There may be scenarios where both the attacking and defending Creatures are defeated at the same time. For example, if the attacking Creature only has 2 HP left and the defending Creature has a Defense Power of 2, both Creatures will be defeated.
  - In such cases, both Creatures are moved to the discard pile. Attacker can collect from defending Creature.



## 7. Activating Character Abilities

- **Definition**: Each Creature card has unique abilities that can be activated to provide strategic advantages.
- **Activation**: Abilities are activated by burning one unit of any collected element, which is then returned to the pool.
- **Effect**: These abilities can provide various effects such as additional attacks, special actions, or interactions that can influence the outcome of battles or other aspects of gameplay.

## 8. How Action Cards Can Reverse Disadvantages

- **Timing**: Action cards are either single-use or ongoing and can be played at strategic moments to change the course of the game.
- **Effect**: Action cards can provide immediate benefits such as increasing attack power, healing damage, or creating other tactical advantages.
- **Strategic Use**: Using Action cards effectively can help players overcome disadvantages by boosting their creatures' capabilities, countering opponents' moves, or altering the game state.
- **Specific Environment Requirement**: Some Action cards can only be played in specific environments with corresponding beneficial elements. Once played, their effects are not limited to that environment.

## Summary

The battle system in **Alice: Cards of Wonder** involves managing Health Points, Artifact Capacity, Attack and Defense Powers, and strategic use of character abilities and Action cards. Understanding these mechanics allows players to engage effectively in fights, utilize their creatures' abilities, and strategically alter the game dynamics to gain an advantage.
