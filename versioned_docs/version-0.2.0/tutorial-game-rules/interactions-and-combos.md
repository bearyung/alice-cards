# Interactions and Combos

"Alice: Cards of Wonder" is a game rich in strategic depth, largely due to the dynamic interactions and combinations possible between different card types. Understanding these interactions can unlock powerful combos and strategies, providing players with a competitive edge.

## Synergy Between Card Types:

### Creature and Artifact Synergy:

Creatures can be equipped with Artifacts to enhance their abilities, attack, and defense stats. For instance, equipping a defensive Artifact to a character with high health can create a formidable defense, while offensive Artifacts can amplify a character's attack capability.

Some Artifacts also activate additional abilities or effects when paired with specific creatures, aligning with the theme or element of the creature.

### Action Cards and Strategic Timing:

Action cards, being single-use, can have game-changing effects. Timing their use to complement the abilities of your active creature or to counter an opponent's move can swing the momentum in your favor.

For example, using an Action card that allows for an additional attack can be devastating when combined with a Creature card already enhanced with offensive Artifacts.

### Environment Cards as Game Changers:

Environment cards can dramatically alter the state of the game. They can enhance certain creatures or artifacts, or provide conditions favorable for certain strategies.

A well-timed Environment card can bolster your creatures' abilities, hinder your opponents, or even change the way elements are collected for a turn.

## Potential Combos and Strategies:

### Element Collection and Gem Refinement:

Combining Creature abilities that allow for efficient element collection with Artifacts that align with those elements can expedite gem refinement. For example, a Creature with an ability to collect Water elements paired with a Water-related Artifact can be a powerful combo for refining a Blue Gem.

### Defensive and Offensive Balances:

Balancing defensive and offensive strategies is key. A Creature with high defense can be paired with Artifacts and Action cards that provide offensive boosts, creating a balanced approach to both protecting your elements and attacking your opponent.

### Disrupting Opponent’s Strategy:

Use Lock Tokens strategically to disrupt key components of your opponent's strategy. Locking down an opponent's powerful Creature or Artifact at a crucial moment can provide a significant advantage.

### Environment and Creature Alignment:

Aligning the Environment cards with your active Creature’s element can maximize your turn's effectiveness. For example, playing an Environment card that benefits Earth elements when your active Creature is Earth-aligned can provide a tactical advantage.
