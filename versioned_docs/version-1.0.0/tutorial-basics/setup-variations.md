# Game Variations

**Alice: Cards of Wonder** offers various game variations to enhance your playing experience:

:::note Assumptions
This tutorial is based on playing **Alice: Cards of Wonder** with the base set plus the expansion set. It follows the **Story Mode** game flow and uses the **full set gem refinement**, where each player needs to refine three gems to win. Specific variations and scenarios will be indicated throughout the tutorial.

## Deck Setup Variation

- **Shared Deck**: The default setting if you are playing with both the base set and the expansion set. Mix the expansion cards into the base cards, shuffle well, then split the deck into two. Each player will take one of the split decks.
- **Individual Decks**: The default setting if you are playing with the base set only. Each player uses their own deck of cards.

## Game Flow

- **Story Mode (Default)**: Environment cards are arranged in order and changed during gameplay in a specific sequence.
- **Free Mode**: Environment cards are shuffled and drawn randomly during gameplay.

## Gem Refinement

- **Full Set (Default)**: Players need to refine three gems to win the game. Each gem requires five different elements.
- **Quick Match**: For a shorter game, players can choose to refine one or two gems to win. In this mode, each gem requires all six different elements. This variation adds a layer of complexity and urgency, making quick matches more challenging and strategic.
